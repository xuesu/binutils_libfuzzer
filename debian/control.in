Multi-Arch: same
Description: GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities for the host architecture
 The programs in this package are used to assemble, link and manipulate
 binary and object files for the architecture of this package.  They may be
 used in conjunction with a matching compiler and various libraries to build
 programs. When using binutils through this metapackage, all tools must be
 used with an architecture prefix.

Description: Binary utilities that support multi-arch targets
 The programs in this package are used to manipulate binary and object
 files that may have been created on other architectures.  This package
 is primarily for multi-architecture developers and cross-compilers and
 is not needed by normal users or developers.  Note that a cross-assembling
 version of gas is not included in this package, just the binary utilities.
